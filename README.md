# R_Unsupervised_Learning

Application of different unsupervised learning algorithms in R.

# Introduction

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant 
marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). 
Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques 
and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
For this first part, we were able to reduce the dimension of the dataset.

## Part1: Dimesionality Reduction in R

The aim of this project is to reduce the dimension of the dataset from a high dimension dataset to a low dimension dataset.

### Approach

We will perform dimensionality reduction using Principal Componenet Analysis using PCA.
We will apply the following approach: We will apply the following approach:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Check the Data
3. Perform Data Cleaning and exploration
4. Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
5. Conclusion
6. Recommendation 

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset

### Technologies applied
R programming language using R markdown.

### Methodology
The medthodology used to perform the Dimensionality Reduction for this analysis is Principal Component Analysis.



## Part2: Feature Selection with R

The aim of this project is to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods

### Approach

We will perform feature selection so as to identify the most relevant features that will influence the marketing strategies and result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax)

We will apply the following approach:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Check the Data
3. Perform Data Cleaning and exploration
4. Perform Feature Selection using 
5. Conclusion
6. Recommendation
 
### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset

### Technologies applied
R programming language using R markdown.

### Methodology
The medthodologies used to perform the Feature Selection for this analysis is Embedded Methods for Feature Selection and Filter Method for Feature Selection.



## Part3: Association Rules with R

The aim of this project is to create association rules that will allow us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset.

### Approach

We will perform feature selection so as to identify the most relevant features that will influence the marketing strategies and result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax)

We will apply the following approach:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Check the Data
3. Perform Data Cleaning and exploration
4. Perform Feature Selection 
5. Conclusion
6. Recommendation
 
### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset

### Technologies applied
R programming language using R markdown.

### Methodology
We used different R libabries to create the association rules for this analysis.


## Part4: Anomaly Detection with R

The aim of this project is to find out if there are any anomalies in the dataset provided.

### Approach

We will create association rules using the dataset provided.

We will apply the following approach:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Check the Data
3. Perform Data Cleaning and exploration
4. Create Association Rules
5. Conclusion
6. Recommendation
 
### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset

### Technologies applied
R programming language using R markdown.

### Methodology
We used different R libabries to check for anomalies in the dataset.
