# Dimesionality Reduction with PCA

The aim of this project is to reduce the dimension of the dataset from a high dimension dataset to a low dimension dataset.

## Introduction

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant 
marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). 
Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques 
and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
For this first part, we were able to reduce the dimension of the dataset.

## Approach

We will perform dimensionality reduction using Principal Componenet Analysis using PCA.
We will apply the following approach: Data cleaning procedures such as removal of missing values and duplicates,
briefly perform Exploratory Data Analysis, perform dimensionality reduction using PCA.

Dataset

Technologies applied
R programming language using R markdown.

Methodology
The medthodology used to perform the Dimensionality Reduction for this analysis is Principal Component Analysis.
